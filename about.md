Hey, I'm Adam. I like to code, build things, read, explore the out of doors, and learn. I'm currently a [solutions architect](https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/solutions-architect) at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), where I work with developers at large companies designing and building payments into their applications. I've also founded, run, and sold several small software businesses of my own over the past 10 years. I live in San Diego, CA.

Keeping this site up to date is a thing I'm not very good at, but I'll try to post occasionally as time allows! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamjstevenson/) if you want to chat.
