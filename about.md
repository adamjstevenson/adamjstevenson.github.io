Hey, I'm Adam. I like to code, build things, read, explore, and learn. I help developers integrate with <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> and currently live in Denver, CO.  

I haven't had anything on my site for a few years, but I'll endeavor to keep this up to date with things that I find interesting. Hopefully you'll find them interesting, too. 

You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/adamjstevenson">Twitter</a> if you want to chat.
