Hey, I'm Adam. I like to build things, read, explore the out of doors, and learn. I currently lead the [solutions architecture](https://stripe.com/jobs/positions/solutions-architect) team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). I've also founded, run, and sold several small software businesses of my own over the past 10 years. I live in San Diego, CA.

I also like to write, but keeping this site up to date is a thing I'm not very good at. I'll try to post occasionally as time allows! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamjstevenson/) if you want to connect or send me a message.
