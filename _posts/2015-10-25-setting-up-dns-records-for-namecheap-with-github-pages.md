title: Setting up DNS records for Namecheap with Github Pages
category: tutorials
---

When I first registered and built this site back in 2008, it ran on Wordpress. I paid ~$15/month for my own hosting through Rackspace, pointed DNS to that VPS, and everything was pretty easy. I wasn't doing a great job of keeping up with the site and ended up taking it down about 4 years ago. 

When I decided to launch this site again, I settled on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you're comfortable at all with Git, I definitely recommend this route. It's incredibly easy and light, Github pages will host your site for free (assuming you're using a public repository), and it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) out of the box, so can do cool dynamic things without the need for a database or any difficult programming. You can even see everything this very site consists of [here](https://github.com/adamjstevenson/adamjstevenson.github.io).
